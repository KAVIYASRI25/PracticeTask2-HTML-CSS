    <h3><center>Rohit Sharma's Test Captaincy faces its first huge test</center></h3><br>
    <img src="https://m.economictimes.com/thumb/msid-100814251,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4,imgsize-56458/concerns-over-dhonis-well-being-and-recovery-became-a-point-of-discussion-for-fans-.jpg">
    <br>
    <p style="padding:40px;margin-left:20px;">It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: Rohit missed three
        of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain. Injuries,
        in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10 Test matches. 
       He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before this stretch of 
       games, a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1 series lead in 
       England, months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia.</p>

 <pre style="margin-left:55px;">               Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is set to miss the first Test
                    against India in Nagpur with an Achilles niggle in his left leg, 
                          and is doubtful for the second Test in Delhi as well.</pre><br>
  <h3><center>Australia aware of reverse-swing threat amid spin talk</center></h3>
  <p style="margin-left:80px;padding:25px;"> Australia are prepared for moments where batting could become 
    chaotic against India, but will also enter the series with an open mind 
    amid all the talk about the role spin could play.</p>
